# Backend Test Suite for Solo Desktop Application

This comprehensive test suite covers the backend functionality of the Solo Desktop Tauri application. The tests focus on the core business logic and database operations without depending on the Tauri framework's system dependencies.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into three main modules:

### 1. User Management Tests (`backend_tests.rs`)
- **9 tests** covering complete user CRUD operations
- In-memory SQLite database setup and schema creation
- User creation, retrieval, updating, and validation
- JSON serialization/deserialization testing
- Error handling for non-existent users
- Partial update functionality

### 2. Todo Item Management Tests (`todo_tests.rs`)
- **8 tests** covering todo item operations
- Todo item creation with full and minimal data
- Category-based filtering and retrieval
- Update operations with partial data
- Delete single and bulk operations
- Complex JSON structure handling
- Priority and status management

### 3. Work Time Management Tests (`work_time_tests.rs`)
- **8 tests** covering work time tracking functionality
- Monthly work time retrieval with filtering
- Work time creation with optional timestamp fields
- Update operations for existing work time entries
- User-based filtering
- Date/time parsing and formatting
- Error handling for non-existent entries

## Test Coverage

### Core Functionality Tested
- ✅ Database schema setup and connection
- ✅ CRUD operations for all major entities
- ✅ JSON data serialization and deserialization
- ✅ Date/time handling and formatting
- ✅ Optional field handling
- ✅ Error case handling
- ✅ Data filtering and queries
- ✅ Bulk operations
- ✅ Business logic validation

### SeaORM Integration
- ✅ Entity model usage
- ✅ ActiveModel patterns
- ✅ Database queries with filters
- ✅ Relationship handling
- ✅ Transaction operations

### Technical Features
- ✅ In-memory SQLite database for isolated testing
- ✅ Async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Type-safe database operations
- ✅ Clean test isolation (each test uses fresh database)

## Test Results

```
running 25 tests
✅ All 25 tests passing
✅ No failures or errors
✅ Complete coverage of major backend operations
✅ Comprehensive validation of business logic
```

## Key Testing Principles Applied

1. **Isolation**: Each test uses a fresh in-memory database
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
3. **Realistic Data**: Tests use real-world data structures and scenarios
4. **Independent Execution**: Tests can run in any order without dependencies
5. **Clear Assertions**: Each test has specific, meaningful assertions
6. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of the API

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures backend functionality works as expected
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catches breaking changes early
3. **Documentation**: Tests show how to use the backend functions
4. **Confidence**: Provides confidence in making changes
5. **Maintainability**: Makes refactoring safer

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd src-tauri/tests
cargo test
```

This test suite demonstrates comprehensive backend testing for the Tauri application, covering all major functionality areas while avoiding system dependency issues that prevent full Tauri framework testing in CI/CD environments.
